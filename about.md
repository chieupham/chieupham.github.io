I am currently a PhD student at IMT Atlantique (ex. Télécom Bretagne) under the supervision of [François Rousseau](http://perso.telecom-bretagne.eu/francoisrousseau/). My research interest focuses on medical image processing.

I obtained the M.Sc degree in Signal and Image processing from University of Rennes I, France in 2015. Previously, I graduated from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam with the B.Eng. degree in Telecommunications Engineering in 2014.
